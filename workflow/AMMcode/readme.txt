1. "gene_set_generate.R" is used to generate gene sets. We used it to generate four gene sets: CIGMA-specific gene set, CIGMA-shared gene set, GCTA gene set, and DEG gene set.

2. "kn_matrix_generation.R" is used to generate gene location files, which are used to estimate kn-matrix in AMM Module 1.

3. The .sh files are the code for AMM implementation. The names of these files are consistent with AMM tutorial (https://github.com/danjweiner/AMM21).
